<h1>The C Preprocessor</h1>

<div style="margin-right: 1em; float: left; padding: 0.4em; border-right: 1px solid rgb(187, 187, 187);"><img src="alex-50-50.jpg" style="padding: 0.25em;" border="0"><br><a href="https://plus.google.com/113987539774523532573?rel=author"> By Alex Allain</a></div>

The C preprocessor modifies a source code file before handing it over to the
compiler.  You're most likely used to using the preprocessor to include files
directly into other files, or #define constants, but the preprocessor can also
be used to create "inlined" code using macros expanded at compile time and
to prevent code from being compiled twice.
<br><br><center>
<div class="noprint">

</div>


</center>
  <br><br>
There are essentially three uses of the preprocessor--directives, constants,
and macros.  Directives are commands that tell the preprocessor to skip part
of a file, include another file, or define a constant or macro.  Directives
always begin with a sharp sign (#) and for readability should be placed flush
to the left of the page.  All other uses of the preprocessor involve
processing #define'd constants or macros.  Typically, constants and macros are
written in ALL CAPS to indicate they are special (as we will see).

<h2>Header Files</h2>

The #include directive tells the preprocessor to grab the text of a file and
place it directly into the current file.  Typically, such statements are
placed at the top of a program--hence the name "header file" for files thus
included.

<h2>Constants</h2>

If we write

<pre class="example">#define [identifier name] [value]
</pre>

whenever [identifier name] shows up in the file, it will be replaced by
[value].  

<br><br>
If you are defining a constant in terms of a mathematical
expression, it is wise to surround the entire value in parentheses:

<pre class="example">#define PI_PLUS_ONE (3.14 + 1)
</pre>

By doing so, you avoid the possibility that an order of operations issue will
destroy the meaning of your constant:

<pre class="example">x = PI_PLUS_ONE * 5;
</pre>

Without parentheses, the above would be converted to 

<pre class="example">x = 3.14 + 1 * 5;
</pre>

which would result in 1 * 5 being evaluated before the addition, not after.
Oops!

<br><br>
It is also possible to write simply

<pre class="example">#define [identifier name]
</pre>

which defines [identifier name] without giving it a value.  This can be useful
in conjunction with another set of directives that allow conditional
compilation.

<h2>Conditional Compilation</h2>

There are a whole set of options that can be used to determine whether the
preprocessor will remove lines of code before handing the file to the
compiler.  They include #if, #elif, #else, #ifdef, and #ifndef.  An #if or
#if/#elif/#else block or a #ifdef or #ifndef block must be terminated with a
closing #endif.
<br><br>
The #if directive takes a numerical argument that evaluates to true if it's
non-zero.  If its argument is false, then code until the closing #else, #elif,
of #endif will be excluded.  

<h3>Commenting out Code</h3>
Conditional compilation is a particularly useful way to comment out a block of
code that contains multi-line comments (which cannot be nested).

<pre class="example">#if 0
/* comment ...
*/

// code

/* comment */
#endif
</pre>

<h3>Include Guards</h3>

Another common problem is that a header file is required in multiple other
header files that are later included into a source code file, with the result
often being that variables, structs, classes or functions appear to be defined
multiple times (once for each time the header file is included).  This can
result in a lot of compile-time headaches.  Fortunately, the preprocessor
provides an easy technique for ensuring that any given file is included once
and only once.
<br><br>
By using the #ifndef directive, you can include a block of text only if a
particular expression is undefined; then, within the header file, you can
define the expression.  This ensures that the code in the #ifndef is included
only the first time the file is loaded.

<pre class="example">#ifndef _FILE_NAME_H_
#define _FILE_NAME_H_

/* code */

#endif // #ifndef _FILE_NAME_H_
</pre>

Notice that it's not necessary to actually give a value to the expression
_FILE_NAME_H_.  It's sufficient to include the line "#define _FILE_NAME_H_" to
make it "defined".  (Note that there is an <b>n</b> in #ifndef--it stands for
"if not defined").
<br><br>
A similar tactic can be used for defining specific constants, such as NULL:

<pre class="example">#ifndef NULL
#define NULL (void *)0
#endif // #ifndef NULL
</pre>

Notice that it's useful to comment which conditional statement a particular
#endif terminates.  This is particularly true because preprocessor directives
are rarely indented, so it can be hard to follow the flow of execution.
<br><br>
On many compilers, the <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/reference/preprocessor/pragma.html">#pragma once</a> directive can be used intead of include guards.

<h2>Macros</h2>

The other major use of the preprocessor is to define macros.  The advantage of
a macro is that it can be type-neutral (this can also be a disadvantage, of
course), and it's inlined directly into the code, so there isn't any
function call overhead.  (Note that in C++, it's possible to get around both
of these issues with templated functions and the inline keyword.)
<br><br>
A macro definition is usually of the following form:

<pre class="example">#define MACRO_NAME(arg1, arg2, ...) [code to expand to]
</pre>

For instance, a simple increment macro might look like this:

<pre class="example">#define INCREMENT(x) x++
</pre>

They look a lot like function calls, but they're not so simple.  There are
actually a couple of tricky points when it comes to working with macros.
First, remember that the exact text of the macro argument is "pasted in" to
the macro.  For instance, if you wrote something like this:

<pre class="example">#define MULT(x, y) x * y
</pre>

and then wrote
<pre class="example">int z = MULT(3 + 2, 4 + 2);
</pre>

what value do you expect z to end up with?  The obvious answer, 30, is wrong!
That's because what happens when the macro MULT expands is that it looks like
this:

<pre class="example">int z = 3 + 2 * 4 + 2;    // 2 * 4 will be evaluated first!
</pre>

So z would end up with the value 13!  This is almost certainly not what you
want to happen.  The way to avoid it is to force the arguments themselves to
be evaluated before the rest of the macro body.  You can do this by
surrounding them by parentheses in the macro definition:

<pre class="example">#define MULT(x, y) (x) * (y)
// now MULT(3 + 2, 4 + 2) will expand to (3 + 2) * (4 + 2)
</pre>

But this isn't the only gotcha!  It is also generally a good idea to surround
the macro's code in parentheses if you expect it to return a value.
Otherwise, you can get similar problems as when you define a constant.  For
instance, the following macro, which adds 5 to a given argument, has problems
when embedded within a larger statement:

<pre class="example">#define ADD_FIVE(a) (a) + 5

int x = ADD_FIVE(3) * 3;
// this expands to (3) + 5 * 3, so 5 * 3 is evaluated first
// Now x is 18, not 24!
</pre>

To fix this, you generally want to surround the whole macro body with
parentheses to prevent the surrounding context from affecting the macro body.
<pre class="example">#define ADD_FIVE(a) ((a) + 5)

int x = ADD_FIVE(3) * 3;
</pre>

On the other hand, if you have a multiline macro that you are using for its
side effects, rather than to compute a value, you probably want to wrap it
within curly braces so you don't have problems when using it following an if
statement.

<pre class="example">// We use a trick involving exclusive-or to swap two variables
#define SWAP(a, b)  a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b; 

int x = 10;
int y = 5;

// works OK
SWAP(x, y);

// What happens now?
if(x &lt; 0)
    SWAP(x, y);
</pre>

When SWAP is expanded in the second example, only the first statement, a ^= b,
is governed by the conditional; the other two statements will always execute.
What we really meant was that all of the statements should be grouped
together, which we can enforce using curly braces:

<pre class="example">#define SWAP(a, b)  {a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b;} 
</pre>

Now, there is still a bit more to our story! What if you write code like so:

<pre class="example">#define SWAP(a, b)  { a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b; }

int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int z = 4;

// What happens now?
if(x &lt; 0)
    SWAP(x, y);
else
    SWAP(x, z); 
</pre>

Then it will not compile because semicolon after the closing curly brace will
break the flow between if and else. The solution? Use a do-while loop:

<pre class="example">#define SWAP(a, b)  do { a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b; } while ( 0 )

int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int z = 4;

// What happens now?
if(x &lt; 0)
    SWAP(x, y);
else
    SWAP(x, z); 
</pre>

Now the semi-colon doesn't break anything because it is part of the
expression.

(By the way, note that we didn't surround the arguments in parentheses because
we don't expect anyone to pass an expression into swap!)
<h3>More Gotchas</h3>

By now, you've probably realized why people don't really like using macros.
They're dangerous, they're picky, and they're just not that safe.  Perhaps the
most irritating problem with macros is that you don't want to pass arguments
with "side effects" to macros.  By side effects, I mean any expression that
does something besides evaluate to a value.  For instance, ++x evaluates to
x+1, but it also increments x.  This increment operation is a side effect.
<br><br>
The problem with side effects is that macros don't evaluate their arguments;
they just paste them into the macro text when performing the substitution.  So
something like

<pre class="example">#define MAX(a, b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))
int x = 5, y = 10;
int z = MAX(x++, y++);
</pre>

will end up looking like this:

<pre class="example">int z = (x++ &lt; y++ ? y++ : x++)
</pre>

The problem here is that y++ ends up being evaluated twice!  The nasty
consequence is that after this expression, y will have a value of 12 rather
than the expected 11.  This can be a real pain to debug!

<h2>Multiline macros</h2>

Until now, we've seen only short, one line macros (possibly taking advantage
of the semicolon to put multiple statements on one line.)  It turns out that by
using a the "\" to indicate a line continuation, we can write our macros
across multiple lines to make them a bit more readable.  
<br><br>
For instance, we could rewrite swap as
<pre class="example">#define SWAP(a, b)  {                   \
                        a ^= b;         \
                        b ^= a;         \ 
                        a ^= b;         \
                    } 
</pre>

Notice that you <b>do not</b> need a slash at the end of the last line!  The
slash tells the preprocessor that the macro continues to the next line, not
that the line is a continuation from a previous line.
<br><br>
Aside from readability, writing multi-line macros may make it more obvious
that you need to use curly braces to surround the body because it's more clear
that multiple effects are happening at once.

<h2>Advanced Macro Tricks</h2>

In addition to simple substitution, the preprocessor can also perform a bit of
extra work on macro arguments, such as turning them into strings or pasting
them together.

<h3>Pasting Tokens</h3>

Each argument passed to a macro is a token, and sometimes it might be
expedient to paste arguments together  to form a new token.  This could come in
handy if you have a complicated structure and you'd like to debug your program
by printing out different fields.  Instead of writing out the whole structure
each time, you might use a macro to pass in the field of the structure to
print.
<br><br>
To paste tokens in a macro, use ## between the two things to paste together.
<br><br>
For instance

<pre class="example">#define BUILD_FIELD(field) my_struct.inner_struct.union_a.##field
</pre>

Now, when used with a particular field name, it will expand to something like

<pre class="example">my_struct.inner_struct.union_a.field1
</pre>

The tokens are literally pasted together.

<h3>String-izing Tokens</h3>

Another potentially useful macro option is to turn a token into a string
containing the literal text of the token.  This might be useful for printing
out the token.  The syntax is simple--simply prefix the token with a pound
sign (#).

<pre class="example">#define PRINT_TOKEN(token) printf(#token " is %d", token)
</pre>

For instance, PRINT_TOKEN(foo) would expand to
<pre class="example">printf("&lt;foo&gt;" " is %d" &lt;foo&gt;)
</pre>

(Note that in C, string literals next to each other are concatenated, so
something like "token" " is " " this " will effectively become "token is
this".  This can be useful for formatting printf statements.)
<br><br>
For instance, you might use it to print the value of an expression as well as
the expression itself (for debugging purposes).

<pre class="example">PRINT_TOKEN(x + y);
</pre>

<h2>Avoiding Macros in C++</h2>

In C++, you should generally avoid macros when possible.  You won't be able to
avoid them entirely if you need the ability to paste tokens together, but with
<a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/templates.html">templated
classes</a> and type inference for <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/templated_functions.html">templated functions</a>, you shouldn't need to
use macros to create type-neutral code. <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson13.html">Inline functions</a> should
also get rid of the need for macros for efficiency reasons.  (Though you
aren't guaranteed that the compiler will inline your code.)
<br><br>
Moreover, you should use const to declare typed constants rather than #define
to create untyped (and therefore less safe) constants.   Const should work in
pretty much all contexts where you would want to use a #define, including
declaring static sized arrays or as template parameters.
