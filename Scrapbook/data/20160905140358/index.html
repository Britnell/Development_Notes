about a document.  For example, it can tell you the size of the
document file, and when it was created, modified, or even last read.
On some platforms, you can also find out who owns the file in
question.  To get this information in Python, you can use the stat
function in the platform-independent <b>os</b> module:

</p><pre>import os

st = os.stat("file.dat")
</pre><p></p><p>This function takes the name of a file, and returns a 10-member
tuple with the following contents:</p></div><div class="yui-u">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="yui-g"><pre class="wide wide">(mode, ino, dev, nlink, uid, gid, size, atime, mtime, ctime)
</pre>

The </div><div class="yui-ge"><div class="yui-u first"><b>stat</b> module contains constants named ST_MODE, ST_INO, etc.,
allowing you to refer to these by name instead of number:

<dl><dt><b>mode</b> (ST_MODE)</dt><dd>The access rights for this file. <p class="fixme">FIXME: summary
0xxx S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, etc. os.path.isfile, os.path.isdir,
os.path.islink, os.path.ismount</p></dd>
<dt><b>ino, dev</b> (ST_INO, ST_DEV)</dt><dd>The ino (I-node) and dev (device) members can be used to determine
the physical location of a file.  On a UNIX system, the (dev,
ino)-tuple uniquely identifies a physical file.  On a Windows system,
the device number (FIXME: always? usually?) corresponds to the drive
letter (0=A:, 1=B:, 2=C:, etc).</dd>
<dt><b>nlink</b> (ST_NLINK)</dt><dd>On a UNIX system, this is the number of hard links to this file.
Under Windows, this member is always 1.</dd>
<dt><b>uid, gid</b> (ST_UID, ST_GID)</dt><dd>On a UNIX system, these can be used to determine the owner of a
given file.  Under Windows, these are set to 0.</dd>
<dt><b>size</b> (ST_SIZE)</dt><dd>The size of the file, in bytes.  <p class="fixme">FIXME:
os.path.getsize()</p></dd>
<dt><b>atime, mtime, ctime</b> (ST_ATIME, ST_MTIME, ST_CTIME)</dt><dd>The time when the file was last accessed, last modified, and when
the file information was last changed.  The times are given in seconds
since a reference time (the “epoch”, usually 1970) in the same was as
time.time() returns the current time.  Under Windows, the time of last
access is usually not valid.</dd>
</dl><p>Here’s an example that prints the size and time of last modification
for a given file:</p></div><div class="yui-u">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="yui-g"><pre class="wide wide">import os, time
from stat import * # ST_SIZE etc

try:
    st = os.stat(file)
except IOError:
    print "failed to get information about", file
else:
    print "file size:", st[ST_SIZE]
    print "file modified:", time.asctime(time.localtime(st[ST_MTIME]))
</pre></div><div class="yui-ge"><div class="yui-u first"><p>The <b>os</b> module also provides a <b>fstat</b> function, which
can be used on an opened file.  It takes an integer file handle, not a
file object, so you have to use the <b>fileno</b> method on the file
object:</p><pre>fp = open("file.dat")
st = os.fstat(fp.fileno())
</pre><p>This function returns the same values as a corresponding call to
os.stat.</p><p class="fixme">FIXME: describe os.lstat and statcache.stat. briefly
describe the time functions.</p><h2>Owner Information</h2><p>On a UNIX system, you can use <b>stat</b> to figure out who’s
owning a file.  The ST_UID member provides this information, but
disguised as an integer value — a user identity.  The <b>pwd</b>
(password) module contains functions to map this to the user’s name.
The following snippet maps the ST_UID field to a login name:</p><pre>try:
    import pwd # not available on all platforms
    userinfo = pwd.getpwuid(st[ST_UID])
except (ImportError, KeyError):
    print "failed to get the owner name for", file
else:
    print "file owned by:", userinfo[0]
</pre><p>The <b>getpwuid</b> function returns a tuple with user information,
or raises a KeyError exception if the user is not known.  The tuple
contains the following fields: (name, password, uid, info, directory,
shell).</p><dl><dt><b>name</b></dt><dd>User name.  This is the user’s login identity.</dd>
<dt><b>password</b></dt><dd>Encrypted password (see below).</dd>
<dt><b>uid</b></dt><dd>User identity (an integer).</dd>
<dt><b>gid</b></dt><dd>Group identity (an integer).</dd>
<dt><b>info</b></dt><dd>User information, like full name, department, phone number,
etc.</dd>
<dt><b>directory</b></dt><dd>The user’s login directory.</dd>
<dt><b>shell</b></dt><dd>The user’s login shell.</dd>
</dl><p>In addition to <b>getpwuid</b>, this module includes
<b>getpwnam</b> which taks a user name instead of a user identity, and
<b>getpwall</b> which returns a list of user information tuples, for
all known users of the system.  The function names may sound strange,
but they are taken from the underlying POSIX C functions.</p><p>If you are going to fetch the user name for a large number of
files, it may be more efficient to use <b>getpwall</b> to preload a
dictionary with the user information:</p><pre>import pwd

_info = {}

for userinfo in pwd.getpwall():
    _info[userinfo[2]] = userinfo

def getuserinfo(uid):
    return _info[uid]
</pre><h3>Password issues</h3><p>An interesting detail is that the <b>pwd</b> module returns the
user’s password.  This of course sounds like a serious security risk,
doesn’t it?  Well, it’s not as bad as it may seem: UNIX uses a one-way
encryption scheme, meaning that you can go from a clear-text password
to an encrypted password, but not the other way around (at least not
easily).</p><p>If you use Python on a UNIX platform, you usually have access to
the <b>crypt</b> module.  Using that module, you can check a password
by encrypting it yourself, and comparing the result to the entry in
the password database.  Here’s a small function that let’s you
“simulate” logging in to the machine:</p></div><div class="yui-u">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="yui-g"><pre class="wide wide">import pwd, crypt

def login(user, password):
    "Check if a user would be able to log in using password."
    try:
	pw1 = pwd.getpwnam(user)[1]
        pw2 = crypt.crypt(password, pw1)
	return pw1 == pw2
    except KeyError:
	return 0 # no such user
</pre></div><div class="yui-ge"><div class="yui-u first"><p>Note that the <b>crypt</b> function takes the encrypted password as
its second argument.  This is because the first two characters in the
encrypted password is a random number, used to make sure there’s more
than one way to store the same password.</p><p class="fixme">FIXME: add information on NIS, shadow password
databases, etc.</p><h3>Caching data</h3><p>If the number of users is large, but you only need to get the name
of a few of them, storing all user names in a dictionary is a waste of
time and money.  Instead, you can look up the identities using
<b>getpwuid</b>, but store the result in a Python dictionary.  The
next time you use the same identity, it is readfrom the dictionary
instead, saving you a (possibly slow) call to the <b>pwd</b> module.</p><pre>import pwd

_users = {}

def getuserinfo(uid):
    try:
	return _users[uid]
    except KeyError:
	_users[uid] = info = pwd.getpwuid(st[ST_UID])
	return info
</pre><p>A function or method that uses a dictionary to store results in
this fashion is called a <i>memo function</i>.  Obviously, this only
works if the result is always the same for any given arguent, and it
should only be used when the number of possible argument values is
relatively limited (at least for a given instance of your program).
For example, using this technique to speed up a mathematical operation
such as <b>math.sin</b> is not a very good idea (not only because the
number of possible arguments is large; the math operations are already
fast enough compared to dictionary lookups).  Another important
restriction is that it must be possible to use the arguments as
dictionary keys.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Python makes it easy to turn an arbitrary
function info a memo function.  The following Memoize class shows one
way to do it; it uses the __call__ method to capture calls to the
object itself, and looks the argument tuple up in the memo dictionary.
The actual function is only called if the argument haven’t been used
before.</p><pre>class Memoize:

    def __init__(self, function):
	self.memo = {}
	self.function = function

    def __call__(self, *args):
	try:
	    return self.memo[args]
	except KeyError:
	    result = apply(self.function, args)
	    self.memo[args] = result
	    return result
</pre><p>Given this class, we can turn getpwuid into a memo function with a
single line of code:</p><pre>import pwd

getuserinfo = Memoize(pwd.getpwuid)
</pre><p>If resources are really scarce (or the data you store is large),
you may wish to limit the size of the dictionary.  For example, you
can make sure it never contains more than 100 entries by adding the
following lines to the above example, just before you update the
dictionary with a new user:

</p><pre>            if len(self.memo) &gt;= 100:
		del self.memo[some entry]
</pre><p></p><p>The only problem here is to decide which entry to remove.  The
longer it takes to create the data that we want to store in the cache,
the more important it becomes that we make the right decision.  A
simple solution is remove a random entry every time a new entry is
added to the cache.  This is not very easy to implement, it is also
more efficient than you might believe.  Especially in situations where
you don’t know much about how the cache will be used, removing a
random item is a good way to prevent worst-case behaviour.</p><p>The following class implements this cache scheme, using a
dictionary interface rather than the functional interface used by the
Memoize class.  To use this class for your own cache, create a
subclass and implement your own version of the <b>fetch</b> method.</p><pre>import random

class RandomCache:

    def __init__(self, size=None):
	self.size = size
	self.data = {}

    def __getitem__(self, item):
	try:
	    return self.data[item]
	except KeyError:
	    value = self.fetch(item)
	    if self.size and len(self.data) &gt;= self.size:
		del self.data[random.choice(self.data.keys())]
	    self.data[item] = value

    def fetch(self, item):
	raise NotImplementedError
</pre><p>Another way is to keep track of when an entry was last used, and
remove the oldest entry every time the cache has become too large.
The following class provides the same interface as the RandomCache
class, ut it removes the least recently used (LRU) entry.</p><pre>class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, size=None):
        self.size = size
	self.data = {}
	self.user = []

    def __getitem__(self, item):
	try:
	    value = self.data[item]
	    if self.size:
		# <i>bring used item to front</i>
		self.used.remove(item)
		self.used.append(item)
	except KeyError:
	    value = self.fetch(item)
	    if self.size:
		if len(self.data) &gt;= self.size:
		    del self.data[self.used.pop(0)]
		self.user.append(item)
	    self.data[item] = value
	return value

    def fetch(self, item):
	raise NotImplementedError
</pre><p class="fixme">FIXME: using a list isn’t very efficent if size is
large.  add an example using a priority heap instead (and
benchmark!)</p><h2>Getting Information from HTML Documents</h2><p>Most documents published on the World Wide Web are written in a
special document format called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).  This
is basically a text format; you can create and edit most HTML document
using conventional tools.  But in addition to plain text, an HTML
document can also contain special markup elements which describes
things like the overall document structure, text styles, and embedded
images.  Here’s a simple example:</p></div><div class="yui-u">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="yui-g"><pre class="wide wide">&lt;TITLE&gt;HTML Overview&lt;/TITLE&gt;

&lt;H1&gt;Overview&lt;/H1&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
An HTML document is basically an ordinary text file, but in addition
to the plain text, it can also include certain markup directives.
These directives include &lt;EM&gt;tags&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;entities&lt;/EM&gt;.

&lt;P&gt;
Tags are used to delimit different sections of the document.

For example, the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag is used to define the document
title, and &lt;P&gt; starts a new paragraph.

&lt;P&gt;
Entities are used to represent special characters and symbols by
name (&amp;&lt;EM&gt;name&lt;/EM&gt;;) or number (&amp;&lt;EM&gt;number&lt;/EM&gt;;), rather than
writing them as is in the text.  Certain characters must always be
written as entities, unless they are part of the markup.
</pre></div><div class="yui-ge"><div class="yui-u first"><p class="fixme">June 2004: The above example is pretty weird, and the
whole description represents a somewhat aged view of HTML, don’t you
think? /F</p><p>Somewhat simplified, the markup consists of tags written in angle
brackets (&lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;P&gt;, etc.), and character entities,
consisting of an ampersand, a name, and a semicolon (&amp;lt;, etc.).</p><p>Tags are used to divide the document into different parts, and to
embed images, tables, and other objects in the text.  When used for
the former purpose, the tags are usually used in pairs, like
&lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt; in this example.  Other tags used in
the example are &lt;H1&gt; for first-level heading, &lt;EM&gt; for
emphasized text, and &lt;P&gt; for paragraph breaks.  Note that since
it wouldn’t make sense to nest paragraphs, there’s no need to
explicitly close them using &lt;/P&gt; (you can do it if you wish,
though).</p><p>The other type of markup, entities, is used to embed symbols and
special characters i the text.  For example, to embed markup
characters like &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; in the text, you must write them
as entities (&amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, and &amp;amp;).</p><p>But enough theory. Here’s how this document looks in a web
browser:</p><blockquote>
<i>Figure: The sample document rendered by the Grail3 web browser</i>
</blockquote><p>If you compare the source document with the text displayed by the
browser, you’ll notice some additional things.  The tags are not
displayed at all, and the entities are converted to characters, as
expected.  The TITLE section is displayed in the browser’s window
title bar, and the H1 and EM sections are rendered using separate
fonts.  Also note that line breaks don’t correspond to those in the
source document.  HTML boldly collapses any sequence of whitespace,
including newline characters, into a single space.  You need to use
tags to separate paragraphs and line.</p><p>For a complete description of HTML, see <i>HTML 3.2 Reference
Specification</i>.</p><h3>Descriptive tags</h3><p>In addition to all the tags that can be used to control the look of
a document, HTML also provides tags which provide information about
the document itself.  For our purposes, the most interesting tag is
the META tag, which in its simplest form provides a key/value pair
with information about the document.</p><pre>&lt;META NAME='key' CONTENT='value'&gt;
</pre><p>At the time of writing, the key names are not standardized, but
major search engines like InfoSeek and Alta Vista uses the following
convention:</p><dl><dt><b>keywords</b></dt><dd>The content field contains a number of keywords relevant for this
document.  The keywords are separated by commas.</dd>
<dt><b>description</b></dt><dd>The content field contains a descriptive text (a summary or an
abstract).  When you search for documents, this tet may be displayed
along with the document title (taken from the TITLE tag) to help you
pick the rigt document.</dd>
</dl><p>Other commonly used fields are author, generator (what program was
used to create the file), publisher, and timestamp (when was the
document last modified).  Here’s a sample document containing a number
of META tags:

</p><pre>FIXME
</pre><h3>Parsing the document</h3>

How that we know what to look for, it’s time to write some code to
extract this information from any given HTML file.  As usual, the
standard library contains just what we need: the <b>htmllib</b> and
<b>formatter</b> modules.<p></p><p>The <b>htmllib</b> module defines one class, HTMLParser, which
reads the HTML document and calls methods of a formatter object.  The
parser class have methods corresponding to the various tags that can
occur in an HTML document, most of which you can override if you wish
to handle some tag in a special way.

</p><p class="fixme">FIGURE: parser/formatter/writer structure, including
typical operations</p><p>The formatter class have methods corresponding to more abstract
text operations, like font changes, paragraph marks, flowing text,
etc.  The formatter module defines two standard formatters, a
NullFormatter class which happily ignores everything generated by the
parser, and an AbstractFormatter class which converts the text
operations to concrete text rendering operations.</p><p>Since we’re out to extract information from the HTML document
itself, we can use the NullFormatter class, and simply overload the
parser method used to handle the META tag.

</p><pre>from htmllib import HTMLParser
from formatter import NullFormatter
import string

class MetaParser(HTMLParser):

    def __init__(self):
	HTMLParser.__init__(self, NullFormatter())
	self.meta_dict = {}

    def do_meta(self, attrs):
	# this method is called for META tags

	name = content = None
	
	# attrs is a list of 2-tuples
	for k, v in attrs:
	    if k == "name":
		name = string.lower(v)
	    elif k == "content":
		content = v

	if name and content:
	    self.meta_dict[name] = content

    def getmeta(file):
	# extract META tags from an HTML document

	p = MetaParser()
	f = open(file)

	while 1:
	    s = fp.read(10000)
	    if not s:
		break
	    p.feed(s)

	p.close()

	# the title tag is extracted by the base class
	if p.title:
	    p.meta_dict["title"] = p.title

	return p.meta_dict
</pre><p></p><p>The parser is designed to parse the document in pieces, so we
simply read chunks from the HTML file, and pass them to the
<b>feed</b> method.  There’s no need to read individual lines, or to
make sure the chunks don’t end in the middle of a tag or an entity.</p><p>We override the <b>do_meta</b> method, which is called by the
parser for each META tag in the document.  In this method, the
<b>attrs</b> argument contains the parameters used in the META tag.
We scan this list to look for name and content parameters, and if both
are found, store the content in the meta_dict dictionary.  The parser
base class automatically extracts the TITLE section, if present, and
we’ll add that to the dictionary before returning the dictionary to
the caller.</p><p>Running this on our sample file produces the following output:</p></div><div class="yui-u">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="yui-g"><pre class="wide wide">&gt;&gt;&gt; import htmlmeta

size, type of image data, and compression ratio.  The easiest way to
get this information is to use PIL’s identification mechanism.  Simply
call PIL’s <b>open</b> function, and examine the resulting image
object.  This operation is usually fast, since PIL only reads as much
of the file as is necessary to determine what the file contains, and
how to read the image data proper.  The actual image is not read or
decoded until it is actually needed.</p><p>The following example determines format, pixel type, and size of a
given image file:</p><pre>from PIL import Image

try:
    im = Image.open(file)
except IOError:
    print "failed to identify", file
else:
    print "image format:", im.format
    print "image mode:", im.mode
    print "image size:", im.size
    if im.info.has_key("description"):
	print "image description:", im.info["description"]
</pre><p>You can derive other metrics from this information as well.  For
example, by comparing the size of the image file with the size of the
actual image data, you can get a measure of the compression ratio for
an image.</p></div><div class="yui-u">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="yui-g"><pre class="wide wide">MODEBITS = {

try:
